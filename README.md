# "The k-nearest neighbor method in the image classification problem"
The purpose of the work: to master the basic concepts of the k-nearest
neighbor (KNN) method in the image classification problem, as well as the principles
of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to
reduce the dimensionality of data. As part of the laboratory work
, it is planned to study the process of setting KNN parameters, including
the number of neighbors, the distance metric and the weighing method. In addition,
an analysis of the classification efficiency will be carried out using
a pre-trained convolutional neural network in combination with KNN.
